## Invocation name
When we use Alexa Skills, we need to configurate an invocation name. With this name we can invocate the skill.

## Intents
I've created intents in a json file. The intents are necesary to trainning the bot.

## Code
The code is a Lambda function in nodeJS.

## Deployment
I've used Alexa-hosted in nodeJS:

Alexa will host skills in your account and get you started with a Node.js template. You will gain access to AWS Lambda endpoints in all Alexa service regions, a DynamoDB table for data persistence, and S3 for media storage
